# A simple RPG demo

This is a small demo which is a WIP. It is essentially meant to be a condensed version of a larger project I am working on. Several features are currently missing because the code couldn't be copy-pasted due to changes in the structure and missing scripts or assets. This means quite a bit of the code needs to be re-written in order to work. I am trying to keep the features as faithful to my main project as possible.

This demo is very bare-bones. Assets are simplified, and I have left some text, hitboxes and other things visible for debugging purposes. Saving and Loading has been disabled due to the game structure being different.

And installation package is included if you would like to try it. There is a zip package and a .exe package for direct installation.

## The Controls

### Escape
To access the Pause Menu

### Arrow Keys or Gamepad Directions
To move character & menu

### A 
Check environment

### S
Dash. (Idle dashing moves backwards, moving in the facing direction)

### D
Use item. Bomb is hardcoded for now.

### C
Attack. This will probably change to an arc.

### F
Inventory (Crude image, nothing else)
