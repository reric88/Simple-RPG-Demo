This is a small demo which is a WIP. It is essentially meant to be a condensed version of a larger project I am working on. Several features are currently missing because the code couldn't be copy-pasted due to changes in the structure and missing scripts or assets. This means quite a bit of the code needs to be re-written in order to work. I am trying to keep the features as faithful to my main project as possible.

This demo is very bare-bones. Assets are simplified, and I have left some text, hitboxes and other things visible for debugging purposes. Saving and Loading has been disabled due to the game structure being different.

An installation package is included if you would like to try it. There is a zip package and a .exe package for direct installation.
